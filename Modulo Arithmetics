Modulo Arithmetics:
                   a ^ b, if b is odd than (a. a^(b - 1))
                   a ^ b, if b is even than (a^2)^b/2
                   
                   (a + b) % n = (a % n + b % n) / n
                   (a * b) % n = (a % n * b % n) / n
                   same with other arithmetic operation
